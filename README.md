# TODO
1) Implement the developed model in VHDL. 
2) Test the developed neuron on the FPGA, evaluate the performances and
   the required resources in order to have an idea of the maximum reachable
   dimensions of the network.
3) Write the linux driver in order to be able to test, evaluate and use the
   developed structure.
4) Write a complete python program that, provided the characteristics of
   the network, creates the accelerator and interacts with it.
